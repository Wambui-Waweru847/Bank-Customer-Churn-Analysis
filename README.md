#### Introduction
Customer churn - the rate at which customers stop doing business with an organization—is a critical metric in the banking sector. Understanding the factors that drive churn enables banks to take proactive steps toward customer retention, ultimately improving profitability and customer lifetime value.

This Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze customer churn using structured data from a bank's customer base. The objective is to explore patterns in customer behavior and identify key indicators of churn through visual storytelling.

#### Problem Statement
Banks face significant financial loss due to customer attrition. Without a clear understanding of who is leaving and why, retention strategies remain ineffective. This analysis seeks to address the question:

“What are the key characteristics of customers who are churning, and how can this information be used to reduce churn?”

By identifying patterns across demographic, behavioral, and financial variables, the dashboard provides actionable insights to help minimize churn.

#### Analysis Approach
The project followed a systematic analytical approach:

- Data Exploration: Analyzed attributes such as age, gender, account balance, credit score, country, and activity status.

- Segmentation: Grouped customers by demographics (age, gender), engagement (active vs inactive), and financial indicators (credit score, account balance).

- Visualization: Built an interactive dashboard using Power BI to track churn rates across multiple dimensions.

- Comparative Analysis: Compared churned customers against non-churned ones to identify distinguishing traits.

#### Insights
Key findings from the dashboard include:

- Overall Churn Rate: 20.28% of the 9,952 customers have churned (2,018 customers).

- Age Group Most at Risk: Customers aged 51–60 have the highest churn rate (56.16%).

- Account Balance: Customers with an account balance of 0 show a 100% churn rate, indicating inactivity is a major churn driver.

- Credit Score: Customers with lower credit scores (especially in the "Poor" and "Fair" ranges) are more likely to churn.

- Activity Level: Inactive customers account for a large portion of the churn, highlighting a strong link between engagement and retention.

- Geographical Spread: France has the highest number of customers, followed by Germany and Spain, with France also contributing the highest churn numbers.

- Gender: Churn is nearly evenly distributed between male and female customers.

#### Impact
This analysis highlights actionable risk segments within the customer base. Banking institutions can use this dashboard to:

- Design targeted retention campaigns for at-risk age groups and low-engagement customers.

- Improve onboarding and engagement strategies for customers with low or zero account balances.

- Refine credit assessment policies to offer more support to customers with poor credit scores.

- Monitor customer behavior in real-time with interactive dashboards for quick decision-making.

#### Connclusion
Understanding customer churn is essential for customer relationship management and long-term profitability. Through visual analysis and data segmentation, this Power BI dashboard offers an effective way to monitor churn, identify risk factors, and inform strategic decisions. The insights gained can empower banks to retain valuable customers and reduce attrition through proactive interventions.
